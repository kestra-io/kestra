### Reporting bugs
Bug reports help us make Kestra better for everyone. We provide a preconfigured template for bugs to make it very clear what information we need.
Please search within our [already reported bugs](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug) before raising a new one to make sure you're not raising a duplicate.

### Reporting security issues
Please do not create a public GitHub issue. If you've found a security issue, please email us directly at hello@kestra.io instead of raising an issue.


### Requesting new features
To request new features, please create an issue on this project.
If you would like to suggest a new feature, we ask that you please use our issue template. It contains a few essential questions that help us understand the problem you are looking to solve and how you think your recommendation will address it.
To see what has already been proposed by the community, you can look [here](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement).
Watch out for duplicates! If you are creating a new issue, please check existing open, or recently closed. Having a single voted for issue is far easier for us to prioritize.

### Your First Code Contribution

#### Requirements
The following dependencies are required to build Kestra locally:
- Java 17+, Kestra runs on Java 11 but we hit a Java compiler bug fixed in Java 17
- Node 14+ and npm
- Python 3, pip and python venv
- Docker & Docker Compose
- an IDE (Intellij IDEA, Eclipse or VS Code)

To start contributing:
- [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the repository
- Clone the fork on your workstation:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:{YOUR_USERNAME}/kestra.git
cd kestra
```

#### Develop backend
The backend is made with [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io).

Open the cloned repository in your favorite IDE. In most of decent IDEs, Gradle build will be detected and all dependencies will be downloaded.
You can also build it from a terminal using `./gradlew build`, the Gradle wrapper will download the right Gradle version to use.

- You may need to enable java annotation processors since we are using it a lot.
- The main class is `io.kestra.cli.App` from module `kestra.cli.main`
- Pass as program arguments the server you want to develop, for example `server standalone` will the [standalone server](https://kestra.io/docs/administrator-guide/servers/#kestra-standalone-development-environment-servers)
- ![Intellij Idea Configuration ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2064609/161399626-1b681add-cfa8-4e0e-a843-2631cc59758d.png) Intellij Idea configuration can be found in screenshot below.
  - `MICRONAUT_ENVIRONMENTS`: can be set any string and will load a custom configuration file in `cli/src/main/resources/application-{env}.yml`
  - `KESTRA_PLUGINS_PATH`: is the path where you will save plugins as Jar and will be load on the startup.
- You can also use the gradle task `./gradlew runStandalone` that will run a standalone server with `MICRONAUT_ENVIRONMENTS=override` and plugins path `local/plugins`
- The server start by default on port 8080 and is reachable on `http://localhost:8080`

If you want to launch all tests, you need Python and some packages installed on your machine, on Ubuntu you can install them with:

```shell
sudo apt install python3 pip python3-venv
python3 -m pip install virtualenv
```


#### Develop frontend
The frontend is made with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and located on the `/ui` folder.

- `npm install`
- create a files `ui/.env.development.local` with content `VITE_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080` (or your actual server url)
- `npm run dev` will start the development server with hot reload.
- The server start by default on port 8090 and is reachable on `http://localhost:5173`
- You can run `npm run build` in order to build the front-end that will be delivered from the
backend (without running the `npm run dev`) above.

If you have CORS restrictions when using the local development npm server, you need to configure the backend to allow the http://localhost:5173 origin in `cli/src/main/resources/application-override.yml`

```yaml
micronaut:
  server:
    cors:
      enabled: true
      configurations:
        all:
          allowedOrigins:
            - http://localhost:5173
```

#### Develop plugins
A complete documentation for developing plugin can be found [here](https://kestra.io/docs/plugin-developer-guide/).

### Improving The Documentation
The main documentation is located in a separate [repository](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra.io).
For tasks documentation, they are located directly on Java source using [Swagger annotations](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Swagger-2.X---Annotations) (Example: [for Bash tasks](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/blob/develop/core/src/main/java/io/kestra/core/tasks/scripts/AbstractBash.java))
