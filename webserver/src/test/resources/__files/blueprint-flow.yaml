  This flow will wait for a file on a gcs bucket.

  We check for new file every minute and once detected, we move it to a subfolder.

  For each file found, we trigger a subflow that will handle process the downloaded files.

  You can generate a file on the bucket using the flow `extract-bigquery-table-to-gcs`
