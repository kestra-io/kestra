## Live Demo

Try Kestra using our [live demo](https://demo.kestra.io/ui/login?auto).

## What is Kestra

Kestra is a universal open-source orchestrator that makes both **scheduled** and **event-driven** workflows easy. By bringing **Infrastructure as Code** best practices to data, process, and microservice orchestration, you can build reliable workflows and manage them with confidence.

In just a few lines of code, you can [create a flow](https://kestra.io/docs/getting-started) directly from the UI. Thanks to the declarative YAML interface for defining orchestration logic, business stakeholders can participate in the workflow creation process.

Kestra offers a versatile set of **language-agnostic** developer tools while simultaneously providing an intuitive user interface tailored for business professionals. The YAML definition gets automatically adjusted any time you make changes to a workflow from the UI or via an API call. Therefore, the orchestration logic is always managed **declaratively in code**, even if some workflow components are modified in other ways (UI, CI/CD, Terraform, API calls).

## Key concepts

1. `Flow` is the main component in Kestra. It's a container for your tasks and orchestration logic.
2. `Namespace` is used to provide logical isolation, e.g., to separate development and production environments. Namespaces are like folders on your file system â€” they organize flows into logical categories and can be nested to provide a hierarchical structure.
3. `Tasks` are atomic actions in a flow. By default, all tasks in the list will be executed sequentially, with additional customization options, a.o. to run tasks in parallel or allow a failure of specific tasks when needed.
4. `Triggers` define when a flow should run. In Kestra, flows are triggered based on events. Examples of such events include:
    - a regular time-basedÂ **schedule**
    - anÂ **API**Â call (*webhook trigger*)
    - ad-hoc execution from theÂ **UI**
    - a **flow trigger** - flows can be triggered from other flows using a [flow trigger](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/triggers/flow-trigger) or a [subflow](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/subflows), enabling highly modular workflows.
    - **customÂ events**, including a new file arrival (*file detection event*), a new message in a message bus, query completion, and more.
5. `Inputs` allow you to pass runtime-specific variables to a flow. They are strongly typed, and allow additional [validation rules](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/inputs#input-validation).


## Extensible platform

Most tasks in Kestra are available as [plugins](https://kestra.io/plugins) including plugins reacting to events from external systems in real-time (Kafka, Redis, Pulsar, AMQP, MQTT, NATS, AWS SQS, Google Pub/Sub, Azure Event Hubs) and script tasks supporting many programming languages (a.o., Python, R, Node.js, Shell, Go) and Docker containers.

To create your own plugins, check the [plugin developer guide](https://kestra.io/docs/plugin-developer-guide).

## Rich orchestration capabilities

Kestra provides a variety of tasks to handle both simple and complex business logic, including:

- subflows
- retries
- timeout
- error handling
- conditional branching
- dynamic tasks
- sequential and parallel tasks
- skipping tasks or triggers when needed by setting the flag `disabled` to `true`.
- configuring dependencies between tasks, flows and triggers
- advanced scheduling and trigger conditions
- backfills
- blueprints
- documenting your flows, tasks and triggers by adding a markdown description to any component
- adding labels to add additional metadata to your flows such as the flow owner or team:

```yaml
id: getting_started
namespace: company.team

description: Let's `write` some **markdown** - [first flow](https://t.ly/Vemr0) ðŸš€

labels:
  owner: rick.astley
  project: never-gonna-give-you-up
  environment: dev
  country: US

inputs:
  - id: user
    type: STRING
    required: false
    defaults: Rick Astley
    description: This is an optional input. If not set at runtime, it will use the default value "Rick Astley".

variables:
  first: 1
  second: "{{ vars.first }} < 2"

tasks:
  - id: hello
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    description: this is a *task* documentation
    message: |
      The variables we used are {{ vars.first }} and {{ render(vars.second) }}.
      The input is {{ inputs.user }} and the task was started at {{ taskrun.startDate }} from flow {{ flow.id }}.

  - id: parallel
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Parallel
    disabled: false
    timeout: PT10M
    concurrent: 2
    tasks:
      - id: task1
        type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
        commands:
          - echo "running {{task.id}}"
          - sleep 2

      - id: task2
        type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
        commands:
          - echo "running {{task.id}}"
          - sleep 3

pluginDefaults:
  - type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    values:
      level: TRACE
      retry:
        type: constant # type: string
        interval: PT15M # type: Duration
        maxDuration: PT1H # type: Duration
        maxAttempt: 5 # type: int
        warningOnRetry: true # type: boolean, default is false

triggers:
  - id: monthly
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    cron: "0 9 1 * *" # every first day of the month at 9am
```


## Built-in code editor

You can write workflows directly from the UI. When writing your workflows, the UI provides:
- autocompletion
- syntax validation
- embedded plugin documentation
- example flows provided as [blueprints](https://kestra.io/blueprints)
- topology view (view of your dependencies in a Directed Acyclic Graph) that gets updated live as you modify and add new tasks.


## Stay up to date

We release new versions every first Tuesday of every second month. Give the repository a star to stay up to date with the latest releases and get notified about future updates.
