## Flow properties

Kestra allows you to automate complex flows using a simple declarative interface.

Flows define `tasks`, the execution order of tasks, as well as flow `inputs`, `variables`, `labels`, `triggers`, and more.

Flows are defined in YAML to keep the code portable and language-agnostic.

A flow **must** have an identifier (`id`), a `namespace`, and a list of `tasks`. All other properties are optional, incl. a `description`, `labels`, `inputs`, `outputs`, `variables`, `triggers`, and `pluginDefaults`.

The table below describes all these properties in detail.

| Property                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`                         | The [flow identifier](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/flow) which represents the name of the flow. This ID must be unique within a namespace and is immutable (you cannot rename the flow ID later, but you can recreate it with a new name).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `namespace`                  | Each flow lives in one [namespace](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/namespace). Namespaces are used to group flows and provide structure. Allocation of a flow to a namespace is immutable. Once a flow is created, you cannot change its namespace. If you need to change the namespace of a flow, create a new flow with the desired namespace and delete the old flow.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `revision`                   | The [flow version](https://kestra.io/docs/concepts/revision), managed internally by Kestra, and incremented upon each modification. You should **not** manually set it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `description`                | The [description](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/descriptions) of the flow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `labels`                     | Key-value pairs that you can use to organize your flows based on your project, maintainers, or any other criteria. You can use [labels](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/labels) to filter Executions in the UI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `inputs`                     | The list of strongly-typed [inputs](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/inputs) that allow you to make your flows more dynamic and reusable. Instead of hardcoding values in your flow, you can use inputs to trigger multiple Executions of your flow with different values determined at runtime. Use the syntax `{{ inputs.your_input_name }}` to access specific input values in your tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `variables`                  | The list of [variables](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/variables) (such as an API endpoint, table name, download URL, etc.) that you can access within tasks using the syntax `{{ vars.your_variable_name }}`. Variables help reuse some values across tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `tasks`                      | The list of [tasks](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/tasks) to be executed. Tasks are atomic actions in your flows. By default, they will run sequentially one after the other. However, you can use additional [Flowable](https://kestra.io/docs/tutorial/flowable) tasks to run some tasks in parallel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `errors`                     | The list of [error tasks](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/errors) that will run if there is an error in the current execution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `listeners`                  | The list of listeners (deprecated).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `triggers`                   | The list of [triggers](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/triggers) which automatically start a flow execution based on events, such as a scheduled date, a new file arrival, a new message in a queue, or the completion event of another flow's execution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `pluginDefaults`               | The list of [default task values](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/task-defaults), allowing you to avoid repeating the same properties on each task.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `pluginDefaults.[].type`       | The task type is a full qualified Java class name, i.e. the task name such as `io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `pluginDefaults.[].forced`     | If set to `forced: true`, the `pluginDefault` will take precedence over properties defined in the task (the default behavior is `forced: false`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `pluginDefaults.[].values.xxx` | The task property that you want to be set as default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `disabled`                   | Set it to `true` to temporarily [disable](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/disabled) any new executions of the flow. This is useful when you want to stop a flow from running (even manually) without deleting it. Once you set this property to true, nobody will be able to trigger any execution of that flow, whether from the UI or via an API call, until the flow is reenabled by setting this property back to `false` (default behavior) or by deleting this property.                                                                                              |
| `outputs`                    | Each flow can [produce outputs](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/outputs) that can be consumed by other flows. This is a list property, so that your flow can produce as many [outputs](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/outputs) as you need. Each output needs to have an `id` (the name of the output), a `type` (the same types you know from `inputs` e.g. `STRING`, `URI` or `JSON`) and `value` which is the actual output value that will be stored in internal storage and passed to other flows when needed.                                             |
| `concurrency`                | This property allows you to control the number of [concurrent executions](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/concurrency) of a given flow by setting the `limit` key. Executions beyond that limit will be queued by default — you can customize that by configuring the `behavior` property which can be set to `QUEUE` (default), `CANCEL` or `FAIL`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `retry`                    | This property allows you set a flow-level `retry` policy to restart the execution if any task fails. The retry `behavior` is customizable — you can choose to `CREATE_NEW_EXECUTION` or `RETRY_FAILED_TASK` (default). Only with the `CREATE_NEW_EXECUTION` behavior, the `attempt` of the execution is incremented. Otherwise, only the failed task run is restarted (incrementing the attempt of the task run rather than the execution). Apart from the `behavior` property, the `retry` policy is identical to [task retries](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/retries). |

## Task documentation

Each flow consists of **tasks**.

To inspect properties of a **specific task**, click anywhere in that task code within the editor. The task documentation will load in this view.

Note that you need an active Internet connection to view that documentation, as it's served via an API.

## Task properties

The following core properties are available in all tasks.

| Property       | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`           | A unique identifier for the task                                                                                                                                                      |
| `type`         | A full Java class name that represents the type of task                                                                                                                               |
| `description`  | Your custom [documentation](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/descriptions) of what the task does                                                                            |
| `retry`        | How often should the task be retried in case of a failure, and the [type of retry strategy](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/retries)                                       |
| `timeout`      | The [maximum time allowed](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/timeout) for the task to complete                                                                               |
| `disabled`     | A boolean flag indicating whether the task is [disabled or not](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/disabled); if set to `true`, the task will be skipped during the execution |
| `workerGroup`  | The [group of workers](https://kestra.io/docs/enterprise/worker-group) that are eligible to execute the task; you can specify a `workerGroup.key`                                     |
| `allowFailure` | A boolean flag allowing to continue the execution even if this task fails                                                                                                             |

## Flow example

Here is an example flow. It uses a `Log` task available in Kestra core for testing purposes and demonstrates how to use `labels`, `inputs`, `variables`, `triggers` and `description`.

```yaml
id: getting_started
namespace: dev

description: Let's `write` some **markdown** - [first flow](https://t.ly/Vemr0) 🚀

labels:
  owner: rick.astley
  project: never-gonna-give-you-up
  environment: dev
  country: US

inputs:
  - id: user
    type: STRING
    required: false
    defaults: Rick Astley
    description: This is an optional input. If not set at runtime, it will use the default value "Rick Astley".

variables:
  first: 1
  second: "{{ vars.first }} < 2"

tasks:
  - id: hello
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    description: this is a *task* documentation
    message: |
      The variables we used are {{ vars.first }} and {{ render(vars.second) }}.
      The input is {{ inputs.user }} and the task was started at {{ taskrun.startDate }} from flow {{ flow.id }}.

pluginDefaults:
  - type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    values:
      level: TRACE

triggers:
  - id: monthly
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    cron: "0 9 1 * *" # every first day of the month at 9am
```

You can add documentation to flows, tasks, inputs or triggers using the `description` property in which you can use the [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax. All markdown descriptions will be rendered in the UI.

## Pebble templating
Kestra has a [Pebble templating engine](https://kestra.io/docs/concepts/pebble) allowing you to dynamically render variables, inputs and outputs within the execution context using [Pebble expressions](https://kestra.io/docs/concepts/expression). For example, the `{{ flow.namespace }}` expression allows accessing the namespace of the current flow and the `{{ printContext() }}` function allows you to print the entire context of the execution, which is useful for debugging.

The table below lists common Pebble expressions and functions.

| Expression                                                                                         | Description                                                                                                                     |
